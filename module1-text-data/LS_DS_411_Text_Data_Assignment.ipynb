    "Your goal in this assignment: find the attributes of the best & worst coffee shops in the dataset. The text is fairly raw: dates in the review, extra words in the `star_rating` column, etc. You'll probably want to clean that stuff up for a better analysis. \n",

    "Analyze the corpus of text using text visualizations of token frequency. Try cleaning the data as much as possible. Try the following techniques: \n",
    "- Lemmatization\n",
    "- Custom stopword removal\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind the attributes of good tokens. Once you have a solid baseline, layer in the star rating in your visualization(s). Key part of this assignment - produce a write-up of the attributes of the best and worst coffee shops. Based on your analysis, what makes the best the best and the worst the worst. Use graphs and numbesr from your analysis to support your conclusions. There should be plenty of markdown cells! :coffee:"

       "\" 11/20/2016 1 check-in Very cute cafe! I think from the moment I stepped in, there really wasn't anything I didn't find cute at The Factory. From their decor to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha Latte and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so cozy, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  Prices are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super cheap, but not too pricey. There's no wifi here, so if you want to study, maybe this isn't the right place. But overall, very nice atmosphere! Viva matcha latte and Cortado \""
